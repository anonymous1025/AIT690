************************************************************************************************************************************************
Write a Python program called decision-list.py that implements a decision list classifier to
perform word sense disambiguation. This method is described on pages 641-644 of the JM text. You
should also read the original paper about this method, which is available on BlackBoard (YarowskyDecision-List-1994.pdf).
Note that even though that paper focuses on accent restoration, the
method can be used with many classification problems, including word sense disambiguation.
Your program should use as many features from the original Yarowskyâ€™s method as you think will result
in an accurate classifier. You are free to add other features if you think they will help. Please make sure
you only identify features from the training data, and that you clearly explain what features you are using
in your detailed comments. Your classifier should run from the command line as follows:
$ python decision-list.py line-train.xml line-test.xml my-decision-list.txt >
my-line-answers.txt
This command should learn a decision list from line-train.xml and apply that decision list to each
of the sentences found in line-test.xml in order to assign a sense to the word line. Do not use
line-test.xml in any other way (and only identify features from line-train.xml). Your program
should output the decision list it learns to my-decision-list.txt. You may format your decision
list as you wish, but please make sure to show each feature, the log-likelihood score associated with it,
and the sense it predicts. The file my-decision-list.txt is intended to be used as a log file in
debugging your program. Your program should output the answer tags it creates for each sentence to
STDOUT. Your answer tags should be in the same format as found in line-answers.txt.
line-train.xml contains examples of the word line used in the sense of a phone line and a product
line where the correct sense is marked in the text (to serve as an example from which to learn). linetest.xml
contains sentences that use the word line without any sense being indicated, where the
correct answer is found in the file line-answers.txt. You can find line-train.xml and linetest.xml
in the files section of our site in a compressed directory called line-data.zip.
Your program decision-list.py should learn its decision list from line-train.xml and then
apply that to line-test.xml.
You should also write a utility program called scorer.py which will take as input your sense tagged
output and compare it with the gold standard "key" data in line-answers.txt. Your scorer program
should report the overall accuracy of your tagging, and provide a confusion matrix similar to the one found
on page 156 of JM. This program should write output to STDOUT.
The scorer program should be run as follows:
$ python scorer.pl my-line-answers.txt line-answers.txt
You can certainly use your scorer.py program from the previous assignment as a foundation for this
program.
Both decision-list.py and scorer.py should be documented according to the standards of the
programming assignment rubric. In decision-list.py include your accuracy and confusion matrix
in the comments. And compare your results to that of the most frequent sense baseline.
Please submit your program source code (decision-list.py and scorer.py) as well as a script
file called decision-list-log.txt that you should create as follows:
$ script decision-list-log.txt
$ python decision-list.py line-train.xml line-test.xml my-decision-list.txt >
my-line-answers.txt
$ head -50 my-decision-list.txt
$ head -10 my-line-answers.txt
$ python scorer.py my-line-answers.txt line-answers.txt
$ exit
